/!\ Note /!\
It is preferable to document work to be done using GitHub issues:

o  implement some kind of user-configurable filter for OSM objects (e.g. show highway=bus_stop only)
o  use filterToParams() optional method of OL.Protocol.HTTP in order to automatically build bboxed data URL
o  find a cleaner solution for map positionning using CSS (make createmap() lazy? is there an event to trigger map initialization later?)
o  unit tests...
o  get rid of BackBone forms and Layout Manager, they are probably overkill for such a simple application
o  finish build process (minify, etc) + include 3rd party libraries at build time, so that we can exclude them from the source tree
